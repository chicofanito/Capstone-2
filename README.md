# Using Machine Learning to Predict Substance Use Treatment Success
![Predicting a Brighter Future A Data-Driven Approach to Substance Treatment Success](https://github.com/chicofanito/Capstone-2/assets/59300889/5d7a3767-73ec-4a5c-a879-1bb6f292ab1a)

## Introduction
According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), more than one million
people have died since 1999 from a drug
overdose. In 2021, 106,699 drug overdose
deaths occurred in the United States. The
age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths
increased by 14% from 2020 (28.3 per
100,000) to 2021 (32.4 per 100,000).This project aims to leverage machine learning
techniques to investigate disparities in
substance use disorder (SUD) treatment
success. The primary objective is to develop
predictive models capable of identifying
individuals who are likely to successfully
complete substance use treatment programs.
The project's investigation is motivated by the
disparities in SUD treatment services and
outcomes. By identifying key predictors of
successful treatment and revealing disparities,
this project seeks to illuminate strengths and
weaknesses in service delivery. This analysis has
the potential to boost treatment success rates,
ultimately addressing unmet treatment needs.

## Data
The project utilized data from the Treatment Episode
Data Set: Discharge (TEDS-D), sourced from the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA).
